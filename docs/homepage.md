# Welcome

Jane is a set of components base on code generation with a strong focus on the JSON Schema & OpenAPI specifications ðŸŒ±
<br/>
Jane also likes performance and that's why the AutoMapper was made, to make property mapping blazing fast ! âš¡

If you want to jump on straight and install a component, please check our [quick start guide](quick_start.md).

***

There is currently three main components:
- AutoMapper: Map data from any source thanks to generated transformers;
- JsonSchemaGenerator: generates PHP model(s) & a serializer based on a JSON Schema;
- OpenApiGenerator: generates a PHP Client based on an OpenAPI schema.
